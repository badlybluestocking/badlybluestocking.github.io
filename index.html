          Matthew's face is so cute. It's really not fair that I have to look at it all day. How on Earth am I supposed to get 
          anything done when he's just over there, being beautiful? Disgusting.

          Hello world!
          I am writing this from the comfort of Matthew's bed! Loving life!!!<br>
          We've had a lovely belated Valentine's meal at a Nepalese restaurant, wherein we were seranaded by a group of 
          (hopefully) drunk middle-aged men. It was a good time. Many carbohydrates were consumed. I love my boyfriend 
          more than anything in this world. I've always wanted something like this, where I could just lay out my thoughts
          and complain about things (and give Matthew a break from me doing so on Messenger). He is amazing, infinitely talented 
          and I'm going to do my darndest to repay him for this kindness in smooches. I love you!!!! <3

          You are amazing, wonderful, and ever so talented. I am so proud of you for getting through this year. We're almost 
          halfway through now. You'll smash your EPQ out of the water, and you'll fly through your history. I'm in awe of you. 
          you astound me every day. I love you. You're doing great x
