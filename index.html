          It has been a busy week-and-a-bit. I shat out my coursework in a day and a good moan about the state of the universe 
          over about four bottles of wine with Almaz and Tyler. On Wednesday I went clubbing for the first time - that was wild. I 
          somehow managed to hold down about 7 different drinks and only pissed twice - a real record for me. I danced on tables to 
          shitty R&B, chatted to a homeless guy, watched a med student swallow a raw egg and vibed to the High School Musical soundtrack 
          at 3AM with a bunch of other drunk, sweaty teenagers. It was lit as shit. Since then I have also managed to shit out my EPQ, which 
          has been a huge weight off my shoulders. I've rewarded myself with an evening of doing absolutely nothing, bar watching a compilation
          of ferret Tik Toks on YouTube :). 
          <br><br>
          Dearest Matthew,
          I really can never express how grateful I am to have you in my life. You are my best friend and soulmate and I can't believe 
          how lucky I am to be able to call you my partner. You are endlessly kind, endlessly selfless and infinitely loving. I love you 
          to the moon and back, my wonderful, clever, talented boy. I can't wait to hold you again.
          <br><br>
          Love, 
          <br><br>
          Freya <3

          Matthew's face is so cute. It's really not fair that I have to look at it all day. How on Earth am I supposed to get 
          anything done when he's just over there, being beautiful? Disgusting.

          People are the worst. I'm so glad I'm not a people.

          Hello world!
          I am writing this from the comfort of Matthew's bed! Loving life!!!<br>
          We've had a lovely belated Valentine's meal at a Nepalese restaurant, wherein we were seranaded by a group of 
          (hopefully) drunk middle-aged men. It was a good time. Many carbohydrates were consumed. I love my boyfriend 
          more than anything in this world. I've always wanted something like this, where I could just lay out my thoughts
          and complain about things (and give Matthew a break from me doing so on Messenger). He is amazing, infinitely talented 
          and I'm going to do my darndest to repay him for this kindness in smooches. I love you!!!! <3

          You are amazing, wonderful, and ever so talented. I am so proud of you for getting through this year. We're almost 
          halfway through now. You'll smash your EPQ out of the water, and you'll fly through your history. I'm in awe of you. 
          you astound me every day. I love you. You're doing great x
